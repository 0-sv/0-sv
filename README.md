I'm currently working as a software engineer at [Katanox](https://www.katanox.com).

In my free time I like to play golf, go kayaking, and travel. I also have a chess rating (around 1400). I've contributed to open source a few times and see myself doing that more often, but I find it hard to combine with a regular job.
# Tools

In no particular order:

## From university 

- Python
- C# 
- MIPS assembly
- C++

## Languages

- TypeScript (both in the front-end as with node.js)
- Shell scripting with Bash or Python
- PHP (not the most loved language but it gets the job done)

## DevOps tech

- Kubernetes (I am CKA certified, but I don't believe most companies need Kubernetes because it has some ridiculous overhead and microservices is not a scale most companies will ever need...)
- Docker (super useful if you want to pull dependencies without the hassle, although I needed to level-up my networking skills to connect services to my host)
- Sentry
- AWS (but I would personally use Hetzner to set-up my own server, preferably Debian to keep the security impact minimal)
- Ansible
- Terraform 
  
## Databases

- MySQL 
- PostgreSQL (personal preference) 
- sqlite3 (I'm interested in using this in combination with read replication to serve small apps)

## Frameworks

- React 
- Laravel
- OpenAPI
- gRPC 
## Testing

- PHPUnit
- Jest
- Cypress
- CircleCI / Github workflows

I prefer a combination of the following methodologies:

- unit testing
- feature testing (happy path testing)
- manual testing UI (since I don't think you can really do UI testing, except for maybe snapshot and regression testing)

But I'm interested in exploring:

- mutation testing
- formal verification
- contract based languages
